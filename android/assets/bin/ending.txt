And there she was. Lying on the ground. Motionless. He finally realized his guilt. Now he is calm and ready to accept his faith and her love.
Don't neglect love received from others. Don't be afraid to give it back. Don't forget to say what others mean to you. Love can't be ungrateful, love can't be unfair. Only you can be that kind of person. Share love and share hope.
